An extension for {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js] that allows to include remote files in {antora}.

This is useful in {antora} which does not enable this asciidoctor feature, see discussion https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/246[here].

== Install

Install the dependencies:

    $ npm install asciidoctor.js asciidoctor-remote-include-processor

== Usage

=== Register as an Asciidoctor extension in the Antora playbook of your website

[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - "@feelpp/asciidoctor-remote-include-extension"
----

=== Include a remote file

In an Antora adoc page, include a remote file

++++
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
[source,cpp]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/asciidoctor-remote-include-processor/master/test/helloworld.cpp[]
----
</code>
</pre>
++++

which gives:

[source,cpp]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/asciidoctor-remote-include-processor/master/test/helloworld.cpp[]
----

=== Include a remote file partially using tags

In Asciidoctor we can include a source file partially using tags, see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#by-tagged-regions[here]. 
The extension enables this very feature.

++++
<pre>
<code class="language-cpp">
[source,cpp]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/asciidoctor-remote-include-processor/master/test/helloworld.cpp[tag=hello]
----
</code>
</pre>
++++

which gives:

[source,cpp]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/asciidoctor-remote-include-processor/master/test/helloworld.cpp[tag=hello]
----

// === Include a remote file partially using line ranges
